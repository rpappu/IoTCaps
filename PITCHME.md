## Four Big Ideas

+++
## 1. Software representations of things

>Anything that can be represented by software _will_ be represented by software...separating the logical content of objects from their physical representation – cleaving the bits from the atoms.

+++
## 2. Invisible technology

> The most profound technologies are those that disappear. They weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable from it. - Marc Weiser

+++
## 3. Measurement, measurement, measurement

> Software is eating the world, but the world can’t eat software. Some of the largest challenges facing our species cannot be solved by code; we cannot program away climate change, water contamination, crowded cities, or hunger. 

+++
## 4. Recombinant technology capabilities

>The more technology artifacts we have, the more we will have, owing to the power of recombination. Engineering relies on the encapsulation of discrete capabilities into modular artifacts that can then be combined to create new artifacts, which can themselves be modularized, and so on.

## Definition
>The Internet of Things makes the physical world amenable to computation.

## Fundamental Capabilities 

1. Communication
2. Hardware
3. Software
5. Management
6. Security
6. Analytics

_Sensing and Power are also core capabilities. I chose to omit them here because they are very domain-specific._

## Communication

### IoT Comms Requirements
1. Low cost
2. Long range 
3. Long operating times i.e., low power consumption
4. High concurrency
5. Efficiency: optimized for short data payloads
6. Mobility
7. In-building penetration
8. Bi-directional communication
9. Global license-free operation

+++
### Governing Equations
Shannon Capacity 

$$C (b/s/Hz) = B\log_{2}(1+\frac{S}{N})$$

Friis Propagation 

$$P_r = P_t G_t G_r \frac{(\lambda)^2}{(4 \pi r)^2}$$

### Communications Tradeoffs
1. Range vs. Power
2. Directionality vs. Size or Cost
3. Bandwidth vs. Power
4. Data rate vs. Cost
5. Computing vs. Communication
