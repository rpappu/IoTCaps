### Core Capabilities of Iot Systems

1. Communication
2. Hardware
3. Software
5. Management
6. Security
6. Analytics

_Sensing and Power are also core capabilities. I chose to omit them here because they are very domain-specific._

### IoT Comms Requirements
1. Low cost
2. Long range 
3. Long operating times i.e., low power consumption
4. High concurrency
5. Efficiency: optimized for short data payloads
6. Mobility
7. In-building penetration
8. Bi-directional communication
9. Global license-free operation

### Governing Equations
Shannon Capacity 

$$C (b/s/Hz) = B\log_{2}(1+\frac{S}{N})$$

Friis Propagation 

$$P_r = P_t G_t G_r \frac{(\lambda)^2}{(4 \pi r)^2}$$
